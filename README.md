# Cluster
A client that connects to a Cluster server.  Designed on events emitted from I/O on the mini-protocol, CLSP.

`Cluster` is an object that implements many objects; however, there are two objects which are most important to `Cluster`...  `Client`, which handles the networking on Cluster, and `Interface`, which handles terminal I/O to create a better feeling environment.
