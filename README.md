Campfire
========
Campfire is a decentralized chatting client.  It's highly configurable and based on top of new technologies like [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/), ES2015 (using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)), [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/), [RSCSS](http://rscss.io/), and [Vue](http://vuejs.org/).  It also supports themes and plugins to bring the best experience to it's users.

## Installing
Campfire is built per release and can be found on [the "Releases" tab](https://github.com/jamen/campfire/releases).

Alternatively, Campfire can be packaged from the source using the `makefile`; however, note that this method requires [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.com/) in order to use [electron-packager](https://github.com/maxogden/electron-packager).

Example:
```
$ make PLATFORM=darwin ARCH=ia32
```
